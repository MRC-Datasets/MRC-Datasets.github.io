Machine reading comprehension aims to teach machines to understand a text like a human, and is a new challenging direction in Artiﬁcial Intelligence. Datasets play an important role while describing or building an algorithm for machine reading comprehension. The type of answers we required from developed algorithm depends on datasets.The datasets are classiﬁed into two types, namely datasets with extractive answers and datasets with descriptive answers. This article summarize both datasets with an example of each type to get better insight of datasets in machine reading comprehension and which datasets to use depending the requirements.
